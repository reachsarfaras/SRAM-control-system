# SRAM-control-system
State-space model and optimal control of Short Range Attack Missile(SRAM) to navigate towards the target using Matlab and Simulink 
Here ,based on the dynamical equations of a missile,A state space equation is derived
Objectives:a)Create a State-Space equations based on the missile
           b)develop mutliple possible scenarios ,that could  improve the flexibility needed to guide a missile
           c)for ex:scenario 1)minimum fuel consunption of missile
                    scenario 2)minimum time required to reach the target
                    scenario 3)hybrid scenario where best of scenario 1 and 2 could be achieved
 Result:
